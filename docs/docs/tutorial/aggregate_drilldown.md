# Aggregate/drill-down

These features basically mean that you add or remove an additional dimension
to/from an axis or another channel. As you can see below, there are some
important things to keep in mind when you use them.

Letâ€™s stack together the elements by putting the Genres dimension from the
x-axis to the y-axis. At the end of this phase, there are chart elements with
the same color stacked on top of each other, which is something you would want
to avoid.

```python
import pandas as pd
from ipyvizzu import Chart, Data, Config


data_frame = pd.read_csv("./music_data.csv")
data = Data()
data.add_data_frame(data_frame)


chart = Chart()

chart.animate(data)

chart.animate(
    Config(
        {
            "channels": {
                "y": {"set": ["Popularity", "Kinds"]},
                "x": {"set": "Genres"},
                "label": {"attach": "Popularity"},
            },
            "color": {"attach": "Kinds"},
            "title": "Stack",
        }
    )
)

chart.animate(
    Config(
        {
            "channels": {
                "y": {
                    "attach": "Genres",
                },
                "x": {"set": None},
            }
        }
    )
)
```

By taking the Genres off of the y-axis, only one chart element remains for
every color, and Vizzu automatically calculates and shows the aggregate value
of the elements.

**Note:** Instead of taking the unwanted dimension down from the chart, Genres
could have been added to the lightness channel to differentiate the chart
elements.

```python
chart.animate(Config({"title": "Aggregate element"}))

chart.animate(
    Config(
        {
            "channels": {
                "y": {
                    "detach": "Genres",
                },
            }
        }
    )
)
```

To drill-down, the same dimension is put back on the y-axis, which results in a
state that we suggest you to only use temporarily when in transition.

```python
chart.animate(Config({"title": "Drill-down"}))

chart.animate(
    Config(
        {
            "channels": {
                "y": {
                    "attach": "Genres",
                },
            }
        }
    )
)
```

<div id="tutorial_03"></div>

We group the elements by putting once again the Genres dimension on the x-axis.

```python
chart.animate(Config({"title": "Group"}))

chart.animate(
    Config(
        {
            "channels": {
                "y": {
                    "detach": "Genres",
                },
                "x": {
                    "set": "Genres",
                },
            }
        }
    )
)
```
